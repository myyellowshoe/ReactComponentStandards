# React Component Standards
A set of patterns & standards to build scalable components across large teams.

## Why
We've had for years standards like airbnb amazing style guides/standards as well as packages like prettier. Though I noticed through my own interactions building and growing teams with large sets of components I needed more. Some of this is preference after years of building front end applications but I try to keep it grounded in solid reasoning. Hopefully this will help other teams as they are scaling there front end teams.

## Goals
- Build components faster
- Reduce code drift
- Levels up junior/mid-level engineers
- Faster onboarding
- Focus on hard logic problems and not structure
